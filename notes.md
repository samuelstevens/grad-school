# Grad School

## General
* [Dartmouth advice](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/graduate-school-advice)
* [Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings)

* Consider looking at data mining as a research topic as well

## List of Schools
* Stanford
* MIT
* Cornell
* Illinois
* University of Washington
* University of Maryland College Park
* Carnegie Mellon
* OSU (Masters)

## Things I want to know for each school
* How much is the Master’s?
* How much is the PhD?
* How long does the Master’s take?
* How long does the PhD take?
* Can I use the Master’s as part of the PhD?

## Stanford
* Can’t apply to both MS and PhD
* PhD is very competitive
* Doesn’t offer financial aid for Masters, does offer aid for PhD
* $18635 - Graduate Engineering 11-18 units (credits), at least 3 quarters a year
* $12110 - Graduate Engineering 8-10 units (credits), at least 3 quarters a year
* 45 units to graduate
* Reddit says people take 3 courses a quarter (or sacrifice mental health) -> 45 / (3 * 3) = 5 quarters to graduate
* 5 * $12,111 + ~$1,000 (fees) -> **$62K plus housing** 
* Seems like MS isn’t very research focused at Stanford, but I really like research, but I also don’t want to spend 6 years in school
* The specializations look so so cool though, all the stuff looks really interesting


## MIT
* [GRE not required](https://gradadmissions.mit.edu/programs/eecs)
* Only PhD, no terminal Master’s degree for non-MIT students
* http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~davis.1719/ - got his PhD from MIT

## Carnegie Mellon
* CS Masters is no research, 3 semesters, no fixed set of courses
* Masters students don’t typically continue into a PhD program
* PhD is five years

## Illinois
[Requirements](https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/applications-process-requirements)
* “It is **highly recommended** to have all application materials submitted one month prior to the deadline to expedite admission decisions.”
* Three letters of rec
* Statement of purpose
* GRE recommended but not required
* Research oriented-degree
* 28 hours coursework, 4 hours of thesis
* Can be counted towards the PhD
* A grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for last two years of undergraduate study is a minimum requirement for admission.
* http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/ did post-doc work at UIUC

## UC Berkeley
[Applying](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/)
http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~fosler-lussier.1/bio.html Got it from UC Berkeley

## Cornell
* http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~heym.1/ master’s at Cornell

## University of Maryland College Park
* [Marine Carpuat](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/) has really cool research in NLP

## University of Washington
* [Tim Althoff](http://www.timalthoff.com/) has a couple NLP papers (2-3)
* [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) is an NLP goat (chair on EMNLP, editor for ACL)
* [Hannaneh Hajishirzi’s](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/) interests are exactly my own (question answering and reasoning, knowledge graphs, NLP applications)
* [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz/) advised Ari Holtzman, who wrote that "Curious case of neural text degeneration" that I found really interesting

## Carnegie Mellon
* Has a really interesting PhD program in [Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/index.html)

## Georgia Tech
* Has an ACO program [too](https://aco.gatech.edu/)
