# Instructions

Prepare a concise one or two page essay in PDF format that describes your primary areas of interest, your related experiences, and your objective in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon. Your essay should be specific in describing your interests and motivations. When describing your interests, you should explain why you think they are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursue them. You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government, or teaching experience. If you are applying to more than one program, you may (but are not required to) submit a separate Statement of Purpose for each program. If you are submitting different statements, please upload as one file and include a table of contents page. Include your name and User ID on the essay.

_Master's in Computer Science applicants:_ Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in Computer Science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.

# Essay

My primary area of research interest is natural language processing.
It's an important field because of just how much knowledge we have accumulated in the form of text; humans can read and understand research papers, personal essays and textbooks to further their own knowledge, but computers are unable to take advantage of our collective knowledge because they can't understand natural language.
Think about a computer that could read could read every research paper previously published and massively improve the speed of development for a cure for cancer.
I'm applying to the PhD program at Carnegie Mellon because I want to pursue a career in research in natural language processing, and CMU is the best place to hone my research ability with the best of the best.

Strong programming ability is critical to be successful in computer science research so that your experiments are not limited by your ability to move from idea to code.
I have plenty of programming experience, as evidenced by two first-place finishes at Ohio State's largest hackathon (with 800+ participants), two internships at GE Aviation, and an intership-turned-full-time offer from Microsoft.
My research experience at Ohio State, however, led me to realize that I am genuinely more excited about research than my coursework or my professional experience.
Teaching a computer to read is just so much _cooler_ than anything else I've worked on.
I would really regret not pursuing my passion in natural language processing research.

Past my fundamental programming and computer science skills, I am espcially well-suited to research in natural language processing because of my previous research experience and my ability to self-motivate on difficult problems.

My undergraduate research thesis focuses on applying pretrained language models to a sentence classification task.
Specifically, I'm classifying whether sentences in an academic context need additional editing or not, and then analyzing the improvements pretrained models demonstrate over traditional models.
Working on my thesis has taught me how to:

1. Read papers and apply their learning to my own work.
2. Support my assumptions with data.
3. Design experiments to answer a specific question.

My classes didn't cover any of these lessons, but working on my thesis made me realize how important these skills are in research.
Having this experience before starting my graduate degree means I am better prepared to work on research problems at CMU.

Beyond previous research experience, I have also demonstrated the self-motivation and independent, disciplined workstyle necessary for graduate work.
In the spring of 2018, I created a mobile app with three other students to help Ohio State students resell football tickets[^ticketbay].
By the fall of 2019, we had transferred two seasons of tickets valued over \$165K between more than 7K users, without any external academic or financial motivation.
Understanding the discipline and long-term thinking required to turn an idea into reality is another facet of graduate work that I am especially well-suited for.

I'm applying to Carnegie Mellon because I want to work on hard problems with motivated individuals, and CMU is the best place for the kinds of problems I'm interested in.
Specifically, I believe that we need a better understanding of how current neural models work on the inside.
At CMU, Dr. Mitchell's Brain Image Analysis group and their research comparing pretrained neural language models with the human brain is exactly the type of work that interests me.
Understanding these relationships will help us understand how neural models actually work, making it possible to continue improving them.
Comparing how humans and artificial models think about edits would further our understanding, and my experience in modeling edits with neural models would be invaluable in that area.

In short, I'm really excited about natural language processing research, I have the fundamental skills to be successful, and Carnegie Mellon has opportunities where I can have a big impact.
